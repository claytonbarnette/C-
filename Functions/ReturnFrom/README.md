# ReturnFromFunctions.cpp

The functionality of this program is the same as the `CallingFunctions.cpp` file. 
The only difference is the return from the `main` function. The `main` function in this 
program returns the return status code from the function instead of `main` function returning
the status code itself.

Below is how `main`'s return is setup.

```c++
    // Return from Funcion for main
    return DemoTextOutput();
```
The output is the same as the output from the `CallingFunctions.cpp` file.
